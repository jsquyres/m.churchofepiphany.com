Use ImageMagick (e.g., OS X or Linux)

convert input.png -alpha set -channel A -evaluate set 50% output.png

I did this on my OS X Mountain Lion Mac with ImageMagick installed via
Mac Ports.  But I see that here at Gator, there seems to be a
"convert" executable installed (when logged in via ssh), too.  It
would probably work just as well.
